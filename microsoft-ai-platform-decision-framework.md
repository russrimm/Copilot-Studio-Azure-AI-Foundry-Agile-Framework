# Microsoft AI Platform Decision Framework

This visual decision framework helps organizations choose the right Microsoft AI platform based on their specific requirements, constraints, and objectives. The framework considers implementation effort, developer skill requirements, and timeline constraints.

## Decision Framework Overview

The decision process evaluates six primary Microsoft AI platforms:
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot**: AI embedded in productivity applications for enhanced user workflows
- **Copilot Studio (lite)**: Lightweight declarative agents built within Microsoft 365 Copilot for individuals and small teams using natural language authoring. These agents use the same scalable infrastructure as Microsoft 365 Copilot but are scoped to meet specific business needs
- **Copilot Studio (full)**: Comprehensive conversational AI platform for custom agents with complex workflows, multi-step logic, and enterprise governance
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Advanced AI development platform with comprehensive AI services (Document Intelligence, Vision, Speech, Language, Custom Models)
- **Microsoft AI Builder**: No-code AI capabilities integrated with Power Platform for business process automation
- **Power Platform**: Business process automation and app development with integrated AI Builder capabilities

## Copilot Studio Experience Governance & Management

### Copilot Studio (lite) Experience - Declarative Agents Governance Principles

The lite experience creates declarative agents that operate within existing enterprise boundaries and provide key benefits:

**Familiar UI**: Declarative agents use the same friendly UI within Microsoft 365 Copilot. Users can adopt and engage with agents tailored to their business scenarios that look and feel like Microsoft 365 Copilot.

**Enhanced Enterprise Knowledge**: Similar to Microsoft 365 Copilot, declarative agents can use enterprise data from Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors and SharePoint files. By applying existing enterprise knowledge and the familiar Copilot interface, workflows are streamlined.

**No New Privileges**: Agents respect existing Microsoft 365 permissions. If a user doesn't have access to a SharePoint site, Teams channel, or Outlook mailbox, the agent won't surface content from those sources.

**Built-in Visibility and Auditing**: Agents are surfaced within Microsoft 365 with standard audit logs, activity reports, and DLP/retention policies through Microsoft Purview.

**Prioritized Security, Privacy, and Compliance**: Declarative agents are built on a secure foundation and inherit all data protections provided by Microsoft 365 Copilot.

**Management Through Microsoft 365 Admin Center**: IT administrators manage agent visibility, sharing, and lifecycle policies via the Copilot > Agents page, including:
- View agent inventory and metadata
- Enable, disable, assign, block, or remove agents
- Configure pay-as-you-go billing and review usage
- Enforce compliance using Microsoft Purview (sensitivity labels, audit logs)
- Manage agent sharing controls via Data access > Agents settings

### Copilot Studio (full) Experience Governance Principles

The full experience supports sophisticated agents with enterprise-grade governance:

**Structured Development**: Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) enables development across dev, test, and production environments.

**Connector Governance**: Admins control which systems agents can connect to, reducing risk of unauthorized access.

**Environment-level Policies**: Data loss prevention (DLP), role-based access, and auditing are enforced at the environment level.

**Flexible Deployment**: Agents can be published across Teams, websites, and custom endpoints with granular access controls.

**Development and Publishing Oversight**: ALM supports dev/test/prod environments, and publishing to an organization's app catalog requires admin approval.

**Management Through Power Platform Admin Center**: IT administrators manage:
- Agent environments and connectors
- Lifecycle policies and publishing workflows
- Compliance via Microsoft Purview (sensitivity labels, audit logs, retention)
- Telemetry and usage analytics

### Migration Path: Lite to Full Experience

Organizations can copy agents created in the lite experience to the full experience when advanced capabilities are needed:

**When to Consider Migration**:
- Need enterprise-grade deployment options
- Want to integrate with more data sources
- Apply advanced security policies
- Require complex multi-step workflows
- Need broader audience deployment (department, organization, external customers)

**Migration Benefits**:
- Core configuration and instructions are preserved
- Unlocks richer customization and expanded connectors
- Enables governance controls and lifecycle management
- No need to start over - builds on existing work
